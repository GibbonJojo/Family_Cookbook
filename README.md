# Family Cookbook

This Website serves as a recipe collection mainly for myself and my family (in german).

It was created using Flask for the Backend and MongoDB (PyMongo) for the Database. The Frontend is entirely Bootstrap as of now, but I plan to still change it up a bit.

* Forms for the Recipes
* 3/4 working CRUD operations (Page and Form for the Update operation not yet implemented)
* Login and Register function
* Standard Search function
* Categories(Main course, Dessert, ...) and Types(Vegetarian, Vegan...)
* Login required function
* Docker and Nginx


## Still Todo
* REST API

* Split routes in different files for better readability
* Picture upload
* Update Operations
* Shopping List creation (like the shopping cart functionality for seller pages)
* Improve Search function. (Advanced search function and/or allow specific MongoDB-queries)
